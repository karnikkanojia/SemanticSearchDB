## Introduction

The FastAPI Semantic Search Server is designed to provide a RESTful API for querying a collection of documents and obtaining answers to questions based on the content of those documents. It integrates various components and models, including:

- **Document Loaders**: It loads documents from a specified directory using various document loaders, such as PyMuPDFLoader.

- **Document Splitting**: It splits loaded documents into smaller chunks to enable efficient processing and searching.

- **Sentence Embeddings**: It uses SentenceTransformerEmbeddings to convert text into high-dimensional vectors, allowing for semantic similarity comparisons.

- **Vector Stores**: It stores and indexes document embeddings efficiently using Chroma.

- **Language Models**: It loads a language model from the Hugging Face Model Hub to perform question-answering tasks.

- **Question Answering Chain**: It sets up a question-answering chain using the loaded language model and document embeddings.

The server exposes endpoints for querying the model with questions and retrieving answers along with relevant source documents.

## Prerequisites

Before using this server, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `pip`):
  - `fastapi`
  - `torch`
  - `langchain` (You may need to install this library separately)

## Installation

To install the required packages, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install fastapi torch langchain
```

## Usage

To use the FastAPI Semantic Search Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd repo-directory
```

2. Set up the necessary configurations and models (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

3. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

4. Access the server's API at `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser or use a tool like [curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make API requests (see [Endpoints](#endpoints)).

## Configuration

The server's configuration and models can be set up in the `startup_event` function in the `main.py` file. Here are some key configuration steps:

- Load documents from a specified directory using `load_docs`.
- Split the documents into chunks using `split_docs`.
- Set up embeddings, vector stores, and language models.
- Configure the question-answering chain using the loaded models.

You can customize the document loading, splitting, and model setup to fit your specific use case.

## Endpoints

The server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /`: A simple endpoint that returns a "Hello World" message. You can use this to verify that the server is running.

- `GET /query/{question}`: This endpoint allows you to query the model with a given question and receive an answer. It also provides information about the sources used to generate the answer, including content, metadata, and scores.

Example usage:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/query/your-question
```
